# About me
<!---
As a recent B.Tech graduate, I am eager to launch my career in the exciting field of Machine Learning and AI. With a strong foundation in mathematics, computer programming, and data-driven problem-solving, I am well-prepared to excel in this dynamic and rapidly evolving field.

My hands-on experience with programming languages like Python and SQL and industry-level tools such as TensorFlow, Hugging Face, and AWS, along with certifications and personal projects in Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP), demonstrate my commitment to staying current with industry trends and continuously improving my technical skills.

I have had the privilege of working on a variety of NLP projects, including sentiment analysis, text summarization, and chatbot development. These projects have allowed me to apply my knowledge of NLP techniques to real-world problems, further honing my skills in text preprocessing, model development, and evaluation. I am excited to leverage my academic background and technical aptitude to make a meaningful impact in a professional setting where I can contribute to cutting-edge Machine Learning and NLP projects.
