**About me**

I am a mechanical engineering graduate, and a self-taught data scientist with a passion for using data to solve real-world problems. I have a proven ability to develop and deploy machine learning models, as well as communicate complex technical concepts to non-technical audiences.

I am currently looking for opportunities in Data Science, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Data Analytics roles.
